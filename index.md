The [Chagrin Falls Tech Breakfast](https://chagrin-falls-tech-breakfast.com) is an informal group that meets monthly for breakfast in and around Chagrin Falls. We intentionally have no preset agendas aside from getting to know the local tech community better and, of course, eating breakfast.

We're open to any tech discipline and any level of experience, from complete newcomers to experienced industry veterans. Job changers and recruiters are welcome!

Thanks to everyone who has participated in our gatherings so far! With so many of us working remotely or for smaller companies, it's great to have a chance to connect outside of the workday.

### Who can come

Anyone! Because we meet in the Chagrin Falls area we expect most people will be from nearby communities, but if you want to make a longer drive, we want you to join us.

Many of us are in hardware or software fields, but all disciplines of tech and all levels of experience are welcome. If there's something you're passionate about, you'll probably find someone who wants to hear about it.

### The rules

They're pretty simple:

1. *Bring Your Wallet*
1. *No Speeches*

We all pay for our breakfasts individually. We may do a round of intros, but you won't have to listen to any messages from sponsors.

That said, in lieu of dues, we ask that you take care of the waitstaff and tip generously - particularly if we're in a large group.

### How to find us

We generally meet at a restaurant around Chagrin Falls before work on a Friday morning. If you plan to join us, please [RSVP on our Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Chagrin-Falls-Tech-Breakfast/) in advance so we know how large of a table to request.

When you arrive at the restaurant please ask at the host stand for the "Tech breakfast," and they'll point you in our direction.

To participate, please [join our Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Chagrin-Falls-Tech-Breakfast/) so you get event notifications and can RSVP. We also have a [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/cf-tech/shared_invite/zt-7wpr6mzk-JFyRQoJQzMlKP6r71R9VOw) for continuing conversations between gatherings.

If you’re looking for job opportunities in the area, please don’t be shy! If you have business cards, bring them. If you want to exchange LinkedIn information during breakfast, do it. We also have an [#opportunities](https://cf-tech.slack.com/archives/CGF9HRL9M) channel in Slack for this purpose.
